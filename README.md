## Story

This repository is a collection of my code, primarily consisting of small and simple code snippets that I use in my daily work or have used in the past. As someone who prefers not to delete any code I've written, I decided to store it here and use Git as a backup.

The code is mostly in Bash scripts, as I am a GNU/Linux enthusiast and utilize it in my daily tasks. This repository is intended for small code snippets, meaning that each snippet is contained within a single file. It can be considered a collection of miscellaneous code.

### Next

I plan to add more code snippets to this repository, including JavaScript, C++, Python, and other languages. Over the past few years, I have written various pieces of code in different languages, and I want to keep them all in one place. 

Currently, this repository only contains code snippets that I wrote in 2024, but my coding journey began in 2017. I will be adding more snippets from previous years as well.
